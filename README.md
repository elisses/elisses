### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Elis Fernanda. I was born in Brazil(:brazil:) but currently I'm living in Poland(:poland:). I worked as Java developer in 2017 as intern. I moved to Poland :airplane: then I stopped to work. New start :earth_africa: so I changed for front end instead and then I started learning JavaScript, ES6, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Redux.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently  not working right now. So that is why I'm looking for an opportunity to meet new people, have a good conversation and build good  quality code.
- ðŸŒ± Also I'm learning ReactJS and Redux. I'm doing a bootcamp by online [RSSchool](https://rs.school/poland/) :mortar_board:. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborating on open source and projects.

Would you like to Hire me?
